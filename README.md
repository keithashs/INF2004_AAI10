# 🤖 Intelligent Autonomous Line-Following Robot (AAI10)

## 🌟 Overview
This project delivers an **intelligent autonomous robotic car** designed and developed as part of the *INF2004 Embedded Systems* course.  
The system is powered by a **Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040)** microcontroller and demonstrates advanced embedded control through real-time sensor integration, PID motor regulation, and MQTT-based telemetry.

The robot autonomously follows a track line, decodes barcodes for navigation commands, detects and avoids obstacles, and streams live data to a remote dashboard — all while maintaining robust, real-time performance.

## ✨ Key Features
- 🧭 **Line Following with PID Control** — Tracks the line using an IR sensor array and maintains high precision (±5 mm error) through closed-loop speed and steering correction.  
- 📦 **Barcode Command Execution** — Decodes Code-39 patterns (LEFT / RIGHT / U-TURN / STOP) with ≥ 98 % accuracy at up to 0.4 m/s.  
- ⚙️ **DC Motor Control via PWM** — Dual-motor H-bridge drive with PID-regulated speed and direction for smooth and stable motion.  
- 🛰️ **IMU-Stabilized Turning** — Utilizes gyroscope and accelerometer data for precise 90° / 180° turns and stable reacquisition of the line.  
- 🛑 **Obstacle Detection and Avoidance** — Ultrasonic sensor on a scanning servo detects obstacles, measures width, and executes bypass maneuvers.  
- 📡 **MQTT Telemetry and Dashboard Integration** — Publishes speed, distance, heading, and state data in real time with QoS 1 reliability.  
- ⚡ **Real-Time Feedback** — 100 Hz control loop and < 20 ms latency for smooth, responsive performance.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. **Hardware Setup**
   - Connect IR sensors, ultrasonic + servo, IMU, encoders, and motors to the Pico according to pin assignments.
   - Ensure stable 5 V power and H-bridge driver connections.
   - Configure Wi-Fi credentials and MQTT broker details.

2. **Flash the Code**
   - Open the project in the **Raspberry Pi Pico SDK** or **Thonny (MicroPython)**.  
   - Compile and flash the firmware to the Pico.

3. **Run the System**
   - Press the **START** button to initialize sensors and enter *FOLLOW mode* (≤ 3 s startup).  
   - Observe telemetry on the dashboard (speed, heading, line error, obstacles).

4. **Calibrate & Test**
   - Use the **Calibration Mode** to fine-tune IR thresholds, encoder ticks, and IMU bias.  
   - Verify smooth line tracking, barcode detection, and obstacle avoidance.

5. **Debug & Monitor**
   - Monitor MQTT logs or LED status indicators for system states: POWER, READY, FOLLOW, CALIB, ERROR.
